# Assembly Simulator
Created for Concordia course MOD7: Computer Architecture. It aims to create a very basic assembly simulator.


## Instructions

The objective of this assignment is to create an architecture simulator that follows the ISA defined next. The
simulator can be developed using any programming language or script students feel more comfortable with,
as long as it is a description language (i.e., C, Java, Python, etc).
Students are expected to create a simulation environment that accepts as input a file describing an assembly
program and, based on the description, the simulator performs the architectural steps to execute the
program. The ISA is composed of 20 instructions, four general purpose registers (t0, t1, t2 and t3), a 4096
bytes stack, a shared memory to store code and data, and a program counter to fetch the current instruction
in memory.
The ALU implements the following instructions, with the following behavior and limitations:
1. LDA *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Load register reg1 with the contents of either the contents of reg2, or the memory var or a constant
const. Memory regions loads (load into a variable, for instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
2. STR *var* *reg*/*const*
Store in the memory position referred by var the value of register reg or a constant const. Register
stores (store into register t0, for instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
3. PUSH *reg*/*var*/*const*
Push to the top of the stack the contents of reg or var or a constant const
4. POP *reg*
Pop from the top of the stack and store the value on reg. Storing in a memory region is NOT
ALLOWED.
5. AND *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs a logical AND operation between reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant
const, and store the result on register reg1. Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for
instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
6. OR *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs a logical OR operation between reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant
const, and store the result on register reg1. Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for
instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
7. NOT *reg*
Performs a logical NOT operation on register reg and store the result on register reg. Memory
regions stores (store result into a variable, for instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
8. ADD *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs the addition operation of reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant const, and
store the result on register reg1. Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for instance)
are NOT ALLOWED.
9. SUB *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs the subtraction operation of reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant const,
and store the result on register reg1. The operation is given by second argument minus the first
argument (i.e., reg2 â€“ reg1). Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for instance) are
NOT ALLOWED.
10. DIV *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs the integer division operation of reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant
const, and store the result on register reg1. The operation is given by second argument divided by
the first argument (i.e., reg2 / reg1). Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for
instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
11. MUL *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs the integer multiplication operation of reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a
constant const, and store the result on register reg1. Memory regions stores (store result into a
variable, for instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
12. MOD *reg1* *reg2*/*var*/*const*
Performs the integer modulo operation of reg1 and a register reg2, a variable var or a constant
const, and store the result on register reg1. The operation is given by second argument modulo the
first argument (i.e., reg2 mod reg1). Memory regions stores (store result into a variable, for
instance) are NOT ALLOWED.
13. INC *reg*
Increments the value of a register reg. Memory increments (incrementing a variable, for instance)
are NOT ALLOWED.
14. DEC *reg*
Decrements the value of a register reg. Memory increments (decrementing a variable, for instance)
are NOT ALLOWED.
15. BEQ *reg1*/*var1*/*const1* *reg2*/*var2*/*const2* *LABEL*
Performs a comparison between two values, given by registers, variables or constants. Any
combination is permitted. If they are equal, jump to the address defined by the label LABEL
16. BNE *reg1*/*var1*/*const1* *reg2*/*var2*/*const2* *LABEL*
Performs a comparison between two values, given by registers, variables or constants. Any
combination is permitted. If they are different, jump to the address defined by the label LABEL
17. BBG *reg1*/*var1*/*const1* *reg2*/*var2*/*const2* *LABEL*
Performs a comparison between two values, given by registers, variables or constants. Any
combination is permitted. If the first parameter is bigger than the second parameter, jump to the
address defined by the label LABEL
18. BSM *reg1*/*var1*/*const1* *reg2*/*var2*/*const2* *LABEL*
Performs a comparison between two values, given by registers, variables or constants. Any
combination is permitted. If the first parameter is smaller than the second parameter, jump to the
address defined by the label LABEL
19. JMP *LABEL*
Jump to the address defined by the label LABEL.
20. HLT
End the program execution.
The assembly program follows the given structure:
Lines starting with ! are commentaries and can be discarded. A line starting with #data indicates that this is
the memory (variables) region. Variables are declared using two entries: *VAR_NAME* *INITIAL_VALUE*.
Variables are listed right after the #data macro. A line starting with #code indicates that the program code is
starting. From this point on, only code is allowed (i.e., no variable definitions).
This is a simple example of a MOD7 assembly file that loads into registers the values of two variables, adds
them and store the result into a third variable, before halting its execution.
